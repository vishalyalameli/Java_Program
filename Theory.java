// Feature	            Compile-Time Polymorphism	Runtime Polymorphism
// Other Name         	Method Overloading	        Method Overriding
// Binding	Early     binding (decided at compile time).	Late binding (decided at runtime).
// Methods     	Same name, different parameter lists.	Same name, same parameters (subclass).
// Inheritance Required?	Not necessary.	                Necessary (subclass must override).
// Decided When?	   At compile time.	                 At runtime.
// Method Behavior  	Depends on method signature.	Depends on object type.

// Conclusion
// Compile-Time Polymorphism is about choosing the right method during compilation based on parameters.
// Runtime Polymorphism is about deciding the method implementation at runtime based on the object's actual type.
// Both are powerful techniques for improving flexibility and readability in Java programs!
